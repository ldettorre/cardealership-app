## Features

### Existing Features

###### Site Specific:
* The site's search feature is a custom dependent-dynamic style search form. What makes it dynamic is that only cars 'available for sale' on the site will populate the search fields as far as Make, Model and Year. This is an improvement over the current style still available in many other sites that might render options that are not actually available on the site.
* The site's search form resets the relevent fields when the user changed a selection.
